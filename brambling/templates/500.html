		<h1>500 Error</h1>
		<p>Seems like an error has occurred. But don't worry, here's what you can do about it:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unless you were submitting a form, try reloading the page. Maybe it was a temporary glitch?</li>
			<li>Let us know how you got here! Help us fix this error by emailing <a href="mailto:support@dancerfly.com">support@dancerfly.com</a> or using the feedback tool in the lower right.</li>
			<li>If all else fails, try going to the <a href="/">Breeze homepage</a> and finding your way from there.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We look forward to hearing from you. Preferably about things that aren't errors. But, you know, we want to hear about the errors, too. ;-)</p>
